"B<fragmaster> is a perl script that helps using psfrag constructs with "
"B<pdflatex>."

"B<psfrag> is a LaTeX package which allows to replace text elements in "
"included EPS graphics by arbitrary LaTeX output. Because B<psfrag> uses "
"PostScript for making the replacements, in principle you can't use B<psfrag> "
"with B<pdflatex> which doesn't have any interfaces to PostScript."

"B<fragmaster> produces a new EPS from your original EPS which already "
"contains all those B<psfrag> replacements. This new EPS graphic actually can "
"be converted to PDF including all replacements. The resulting "
"\"encapsulated\" PDF can then be used with pdflatex."

"B<fragmaster> will scan the current directory for files which end in F<_fm> "

"necessary (a little like \"make\" would do it)."

"In case the EPS will be produced as landscape graphics, i.e. B<gv> shows "

"versions of B<dvips> make the \"smart\" assumption that your graphic is "
"landscape, even though the graphic's proportions don't tell anything about "
